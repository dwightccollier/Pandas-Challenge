The main file to run will be the starter file originally provided that has been completed based on what was asked of me. The formatting might be a bit off, 
I couldn't figure out how to fix that, the data however is correct and my observations based on that data have not been hindered in anyway. The file is called 'PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb'
and it is located in the PyCitySchools folder, it should be run with Pandas installed otherwise it will not work
